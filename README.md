# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**


a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.

->To run the code, you have to run `npm start`.

b. List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and 
that exemplify your proficiency. Please describe why you chose those elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.

-> Working on the given task challenged me on different parameters,be it responsive UI ,the API calls or the error handling.I enjoyed the task throughout.The
most exicting part came when we are trying of fetch movie details.While trying to fetch the Movie Title,Rating,Year of release,Length (HH:MM),Description are present on a details API but when Director and Cast were present on another(credits API).Finding the directors name was a bit challenging , to go through so many consol.log,was fun and cahllenging.So the selection of API was also important and the way to implement them together without any noticable changes were exicting.The search part was also fun to work on.Overall I would state that I have done a good job on Serach,API calls and achieving the desired UI as stated.



c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours 
available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.

-> I would have implemented a register and login page , if I had more time.
